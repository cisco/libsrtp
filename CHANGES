Changelog

2.1.0

  Major changes

  PR 261 & 241 - Improved logging API to receive log messages from libSRTP
    Provides a logging API and the ability to enable logging to stdout and file
    as well as a switch to enable all internal debug logging.

  PR 259 - Sequence number incorrectly masked for AES GCM IV
    The initializing vector for AES GCM encryption was incorrectly formed on
    little endian machines.
    This change will break backwards compatibility with older versions (1.5,
    2.0) of libSRTP when using the AES GCM cipher for RTCP.

  PR 234 - Report ssrc instead of srtp_stream_t in srtp_event_data_t
    srtp_stream_t is an opaque type making the event framework almost useless,
    now the ssrc is returned instead for use as a key in the public API.

  PR 224 - Master Key Identifiers (MKI) Support patch
    Adds MKI support with up to 4 keys.
